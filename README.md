# German Flashcards

A minimalist vintage-style flashcard web app for learning German vocabulary.

## Files

- `index.html` - Main flashcard application (don't edit this)
- `vocab.txt` - Your vocabulary list (edit this to add/modify words)

## How to Update Vocabulary

Simply edit `vocab.txt` using any text editor. The format is super simple:

```
English word | German word | Optional hint
```

### Rules:
- Separate English and German with a pipe character: `|`
- One word/phrase per line
- Lines starting with `//` are comments (ignored)
- Empty lines are ignored
- Third column (hint) is optional

### Example:
```
// Greetings
Hello | Hallo
Goodbye | Tschüss | informal
Thank you | Danke

// Food
Apple | der Apfel | masculine noun
```

That's it! Just save the file and refresh your webpage.
